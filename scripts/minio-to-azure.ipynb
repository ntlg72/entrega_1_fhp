    "# 3. Minio-to-Azure\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook outlines the process of moving a Parquet file, managed as an Iceberg table using the Nessie catalog, from the `grupo-2` bucket in MinIO to a group-specific folder in Azure storage. The workflow employs `dlt` and Iceberg libraries to facilitate the transfer, ensuring data integrity and compatibility with Azureâ€™s storage system. This requires MinIO access, Azure credentials, and the Iceberg library installation."
